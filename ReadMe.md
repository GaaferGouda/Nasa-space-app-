 Data Analysis Project: Exoplanets Dataset Analysis 

In this project, I explore a dataset of exoplanets, planets outside our solar system, aiming to extract insights using data analysis techniques. The dataset contains information on 1013 exoplanets and their properties, including mass, radius, orbital period, orbital radius, and host star characteristics.


##  Research Questions

- How many planets are in the habitable zone?
- Is there a relationship between planet radius and star luminosity?
- Is there a relationship between planet mass and star mass?
- Is there a relationship between orbital period and star radius?

##  Project Structure

- **data:** Contains the dataset used in the analysis.
- **notebooks:** Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis and visualization.
- **reports:** Contains a detailed project report.

##  Usage
- Navigate to the notebooks folder.
- Run the Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis.
- Customize the analysis as needed for your exploration.

##  Additional Information:

- Dataset units are relative to Earth or the Sun.
- Habitable Zone Distance criteria are applied for potential habitability.
- Estimated one planet per star in our galaxy.
